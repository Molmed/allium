# Jupyter notebooks for testing ALLIUM on public DNAm and GEX datasets

1. DiscoveryPhase_DNAm_Test_data.ipynb: ALLIUM is implemented on DNAm data from the GSE56600 entry (227 pediatric B-cell ALL samples ([Lee et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkv103))).
2. DiscoveryPhase_GEX_Test_data.ipynb: ALLIUM is implemented on GEX data from the GSE16150 entry(19 pediatric B-cell ALL samples ([Diedrich et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41375-021-01209-1))).

+ Additionally provided: sub_colors.pkl: a pickle file with a dictionary of our 17 subtypes, B-other and Controls as keys and HEX colors as values. This allows the use of subtype order as we have it on our manuscript as well as using the same colors for the subtypes for other visualizations.
